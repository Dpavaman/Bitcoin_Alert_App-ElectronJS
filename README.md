## Bitcoin Alert App.

**This App is built using Electron.js for Learning purpose** 
* Application on Launch fetches current BTC value in USD and displays on the screen
* The BTC value of USD is refreshed by fetching the API response every 30 seconds
* User can click on Notify button which will launch a child window 
* User can set a target in the Child window and click on Update 
* Application triggers a system notification whenever the BTC value of USD rises above the target given by the user in coming fetches.


Originally planned to display and set a target for BTC value of INR (Indian National Rupees) but the API provides exact value for USD and EUR. Thus changed to USD
